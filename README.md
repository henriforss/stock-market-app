# Stock Market App

This is a React app that retrieves data from the Nasdaq Data Link API and displays it with D3.js.

The app makes an API call every time the user wants to display stock market data. The data is limited to certain US companies and two months time period in 2017 due to limitations in the free tier API.

The functionality of the app is divided in several components. Mouseover on the svg works perfectly only on desktop. On mobile mouseover is replace by clicking.
